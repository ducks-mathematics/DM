  <h1>What Is Quantum Mechanics?</h1>
  <p><strong>The Most Mind-Bending Science of All Time</strong></p>

  <p>
    Quantum Mechanics is one of the most fascinating and challenging branches of science.
    It explains how the universe behaves at its smallest scale — atoms, electrons, photons,
    and the building blocks of reality.
  </p>

  <p>
    At this scale, nature behaves very differently from our everyday experience.
    Objects can act like waves, particles can exist in multiple states,
    and outcomes can only be predicted as probabilities.
  </p>

  <h2>The World Beneath the World</h2>
  <p>
    Everything around us — phones, books, air, light — is made of tiny particles.
    Classical physics explains large objects well, but it fails at the atomic level.
  </p>

  <p>
    When scientists began studying this microscopic world,
    they discovered that the familiar rules no longer applied.
  </p>

  <h2>The Birth of Quantum Physics</h2>
  <p>
    In the early twentieth century, scientists such as Max Planck,
    Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg, and Erwin Schrödinger
    observed experimental results that classical physics could not explain.
  </p>

  <p>
    Energy appeared in discrete units, electrons jumped between energy levels,
    and measurement itself influenced results.
    These discoveries led to the development of quantum mechanics.
  </p>

  <h2>Strange Rules of the Quantum World</h2>

  <h3>1. Wave–Particle Duality</h3>
  <p>
    Light and matter can behave as both waves and particles.
    Their behavior depends on how they are observed.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Superposition</h3>
  <p>
    A quantum system can exist in multiple possible states at the same time.
    Only when measured does it settle into one outcome.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Quantum Entanglement</h3>
  <p>
    Some particles become deeply connected.
    A change in one can instantly affect the other,
    even across great distances.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Quantum Mechanics Matters</h2>
  <p>
    Quantum mechanics is not just theoretical.
    It is the foundation of modern technology.
  </p>

  <p>
    Microchips, lasers, medical imaging, solar panels,
    and emerging quantum computers all rely on quantum principles.
  </p>

  <h2>Understanding Reality</h2>
  <p>
    Quantum mechanics teaches us that certainty does not exist at the deepest level of nature.
    Instead, probability plays a fundamental role.
    This challenges our intuition but provides a more accurate description of reality.
  </p>

  <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
  <p>
    Quantum mechanics reveals a universe that is subtle, complex, and deeply interconnected.
    It reminds us that nature does not always behave in ways we expect.
  </p>

  <p><strong>
    Learning quantum mechanics is not just about physics —
    it is about understanding the hidden structure of reality itself.
